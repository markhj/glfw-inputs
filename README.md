**GLFW Inputs** is a library designed to streamline and abstract variou
control interfaces  for C++'s GLFW library, often used for OpenGL
applications.

# 📢 Features

The current version of **GLFW Inputs** sports the following headline features:

🎮 **Keyboard, mouse**, **joystick** and **gamepad** support

🔄 **Swappable key mappings** to easily manage purpose of controls, for instance
whether in-game or in main menu.

🔉 **Signal-based** event handling separates processing of the actual physical
input from translation to an action.

🅰️ **Button states** for all controls to determine if a button is just pressed,
held down or just released.

📐 **Abstracted** such that every control type have streamlined and predictable
usage

# 🌿 Requirements

GLFW Inputs require:

* C++ 17 or higher*
* CMake 3.26 or higher
* GLFW3

*) _Due to use of ``std::optional`` versions prior to C++ 17 won't work_

# 📖 Documentation

You can read about installation, usage and more on:
https://glfw-inputs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# 🚗 Roadmap

Features that will be implemented in the future:

* Sample apps
* Support for key combinations (on all control types)
* Manage cursor position and visibility
* Improved mapping of joystick buttons and axes

# ✏️ Host documentation locally

To run host the documentation locally, you must have
Python and Mkdocs already installed.

Then use:

````bash
python mkdocs serve
````

On some Windows machines, it will be necessary to run with:

````bash
python -m mkdocs serve
````

# 📜 Notes

Under the hood, some properties and methods are static.
As long as you follow the manual, this can be ignored. This is
due to how GLFW works. But in practice the classes can be used
as instantiable objects.
