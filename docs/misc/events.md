# Events ðŸŽ²

## ``Event``
Enumerator used to describe a button state (whether keyboard, mouse or joystick).

| Enumeration              | Description                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ``Event::ButtonPress``   | When button/key just pressed     |
| ``Event::ButtonDown``    | While button/key is held down    |
| ``Event::ButtonRelease`` | When button/key is just released |

Please read [Button down state](../getting-started/button-down-states.md) regarding
use of ``ButtonDown``.

## ``DeviceEvent``
Used to describe hardware-specific events of a device.

| Enumeration                   | Description                                                              |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``DeviceEvent::Disconnected`` | When a device is physically plugged out (or wireless connection is lost) |
| ``DeviceEvent::Connected``    | When a device is (re-)connected                                          |

> ``DeviceEvent::Connected`` does _**not**_ fire, when a device is already connected as the application launches.
> In other words, you cannot count on this event to do initial setup work.

## ``InputEvent``
_**Only used internally in the library**_

The ``InputEvent`` is typically generated by the GLFW callbacks which
compile information into a streamlined ``InputEvent``.

## ``MappedInputEvent``
_**Only used internally in the library**_

A combination of event, input and signal, used to store how inputs map
to signals.

## ``MappedDeviceEvent``
_**Only used internally in the library**_

A combination of ``DeviceEvent`` and signal, used to store how hardware-specific events map
to signals.
